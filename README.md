# rust-programming-practice
Completed Guess Game project and learnt new concepts like mutability, unsigned (conversion of strings into integers) and match. Apart from it, some of the libraries too like random (rand) generate range (rng or Rng), compare (cmp) library and ordering concepts.
Learning is nice, practising is something, only engineers do ;)
