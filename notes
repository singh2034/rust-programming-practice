cargo init for making new cargo file in a manual project.
cargo new project_name :- used for new project with cargo build in it. 
cargo is a package manager for rust programming language.
rustc main.rs or file name :- gives you an executable file for the same project. ( but gcc/gcc+ must be installed - build essentials.)
cargo check :- for checking the program without any executable file.
cargo build :- gives you an executable file - ./target/debug/program_name
rust uses snake_case strictly or gives you an error if not used correctly.
cargo run :- directly gives you the executable file and run the program with code check.
Programming is set of instructions :- always remember.
